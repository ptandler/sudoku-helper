= The Stupid Simple Sudoku Helper (sudoku-helper)

A very simple tool written in TypeScript with Vue.js to help solving Sukodus (and to understand the rules to solve).

Goal of this project:

1. I wanted a sample project to learn Vue.js and Typescript
2. Do something I like while my family solves Sudokus ...
3. A tool that can help interactively with complicated Sudoku puzzles, and helping me understand how far one gets while applying certain rules when solving a sudoku.

== Features

- highlighting of the corresponding "collections" (i.e. a row, column, or square) a selected cell is contained in
- save and load the game state
- highligt errors

=== Solution rules / heuristics that can be applied automatically

_Well, yes, one might ask, what's the point when the App automatically applies the rules ... for me the fun is more in coding :-)_

- Update the list of possible values in each cell (check that the rules all apply)
- Assign all Cells with Single Possible Value (i.e. a list of possible values that has the length 1.
- Assign Cells that have a Single Possible Value in all collections, i.e. check all rows, columns, and squares if there is a single position where a given value can be placed
- show missing numbers in UI per row and col (no idea where to show the missing ones for each square ...)

== ToDo-List / Ideas for Improvement

- Undo history
- buttons to highlight a specific value (e.g. all cells with value "1")
- auto mode: with Ctrl-Click on (some) buttons, automatically exec this action as soon as a value is changed (recursively); the button stays in the "pressed" mode then; will be deselected upon next click
- Load and Save multiple games
- Some import / export features (is there any widely adopted format? What about a simple JSON matrix in addition to the internal simplified JSON format?
- Animation if the value of a cell changes
- add buttons / functions for more rules / heuristics (are there more required?)
- add support for touch-only devices to use without keyboard
- include one of the sudoku generators (that can specify how easy / hard it should be)
